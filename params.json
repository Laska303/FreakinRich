{"body":"### FreakinRich game\r\nFreakinRich was an academic project developed during my MSc, in which the main goal was to create a game of chance / board game, in c# and Windows Forms.\r\n\r\n### Additional content\r\nTo find out more about this project and its implementation check the following links:\r\n* FreakinRich report - http://db.tt/3K5IL5sj\r\n* User guide - http://db.tt/suGwzXT0\r\n* Ready to play and compiled version - http://db.tt/Mqjo6JkJ\r\n\r\n### Test the game\r\nFor testing purposes, an user can start multiple instancies of FreakinRich in order to play the role of multiple players (with a maximum limit of 4 players). In that case the user must provide his computer's IP, or the localhost IP address (127.0.0.1).\r\n\r\n### Play the game\r\n\r\nTo initiate a new game, the user must click on the first button (red house icon) of the game menu. \r\n\r\n![menuGame](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9165833/FreakinRich%20imagens/novo.png)\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that there are at least two players in game, the dice button is shown to the player that initiated the game.\r\nAt this point, if that player press the dice button, the game starts and no more payers are allowed to join the match.\r\n\r\nTo join a match already created, the player must click on the second button (green house icon) of the menu game. After that, the game requests the computer's IP address of the player who started the match.\r\nRight after the player inserts his name as also requested, he's ready to play. As shown in the picture below, the red marker next to the players names represents the turn marker in the game, and it defines of whose turn it is to play.\r\n\r\n![turnMarker](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9165833/FreakinRich%20imagens/painel_jogadores.PNG)\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
