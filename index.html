          <h3>FreakinRich game</h3>

<p>FreakinRich was an academic project developed during my MSc, in which the main goal was to create a game of chance / board game, in c# and Windows Forms.</p>

<h3>Play the game</h3>

<p>To initiate a new game, the user must click on the first button (red house icon) of the game menu. </p>

<p>From the moment that there are at least two players in game, the dice button is shown to the player that initiated the game.
At this point, if that player press the dice button, the game starts and  no more payers are allowed to join the match.</p>

<p>To a player join a match already created, he must click on the second button (green house icon) of the menu game. After that, it is requested to the player to provide in a text box the computer's IP address of the player who started the match.
Right after the player inserts his name as also requested, he's ready to play. As shown in the picture below, the red marker next to the players names is the turn marker and it defines of whose turn it is to play.</p>

<h3>Test the game</h3>

<p>For testing purposes, the player who starts the game can also be the other participating players. For this he must run the game once more (or the number of times wanted), and provide his pc IP (or the localhost IP address 127.0.0.1).</p>
